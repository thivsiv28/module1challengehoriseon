Module 1 Challenge-HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

For this first challenge, we had to refactor some code inorder to make it more accessible and make sure it had followed a semantic order. 

I did the following by:
- Ordering in order of ranks of selector (eg. univeral, element , class)
- Ordering all the selectors in albhapetical order
- Made more accesible by the use of alt and key image words
- Consolidated lines of repetative code and elimnated unnessary selectors
-Added comments with with what was revised
-Changed the div tag and used semantic structure and elements throughout the code
